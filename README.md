# To do list

## Description:

This to do list app was designed for users who have the need to organise their daily, weekly or monthly tasks. As developers, we tend to receive many tasks throughout a project. Therefore, this has motivated us to create an app where we can organise and prioritise tasks. 

It is relevant to highlight that the local storage will not clear your data after refreshing the page. The intention is to keep your tasks saved until you have finalised it. 



## Instructions:
For those who are new users of the app, find some instructions below:

*In order to add a new item to your list, type in the input field and click in the plus sign on the right.
*Once your item is added to the list, you have 3 options: mark the task as done, edit it or delete it. 
*At the bottom of list, there are 2 additional buttons: clear all and history.
*Clear all button: once you are finalised, this button will clear all your tasks, without the need of selecting them individually. 
*Once all your tasks are done, a "you are up to date message" should be displayed.
